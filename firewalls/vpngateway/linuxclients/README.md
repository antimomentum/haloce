These are example guided client installers for the Wireguard setup as well as Docker installs to run Halo in Wine containers. Only one of these would be run on a fresh server that will run halo.


## Requires:

A wireguard gateway for the wireguard connection. A client.conf generated by the gateway will be saved on the client as:

/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf



The start-example.sh will use whatever halo server files you put into the halopull directory. The halo files provided are simply for troubleshooting purposes.
Feel free to use your own halo files. This script will attempt to properly start the tunnel, and then a halo server.



## Proper shutdown:

In the halo console type "quit" and press enter to stop halo and close the container. Then to stop the wireguard tunnel do:


wg-quick down wg0


. It is important halo is closed BEFORE the vpn connection or the halo server's real ip may leak!

If something should go wrong with the container itself:


docker ps


will list the container(s) name(s) at which point you can:


docker stop containername


to forcefully stop the container.
